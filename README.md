## 🚀 About This Project

Memory Puzzle is a classic 2D game that focuses on strong UI/UX, game state management, and event-driven programming. The player is challenged to find all matching pairs on a **4x4 grid** within a set time limit and with only **5 incorrect attempts**.

This project demonstrates my ability to create a complete and polished game loop, integrating UI, animations, and audio feedback to create a "juicy" and satisfying player experience.

## ✨ Key Features

* **4x4 Card Grid:** A classic 16-card layout for a balanced challenge.
* **Limited Attempts:** The player has only 5 lives (incorrect guesses) before the game is over.
* **Countdown Timer:** A real-time timer adds a layer of pressure and a separate fail-state.
* **Smooth Card Animations:** Custom animations for card flips, matches, and mismatches, all handled by the Unity Animator.
* **Juicy Particle Effects:** Visual feedback (e.g., sparkles, stars) triggers on a correct match.
* **Full Audio Feedback:** Sound effects for card flips, correct matches, incorrect matches, and win/lose states.
* **Game State Management:** A robust system manages the game state, tracking attempts, time, and win/loss conditions (Win, Lose-Time, Lose-Attempts).
